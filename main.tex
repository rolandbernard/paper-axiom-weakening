%% article.
\begin{abstract}
Axiom weakening is a technique that allows for a fine-grained repair of inconsistent ontologies. Its main advantage is that it repairs ontologies by making axioms
less restrictive rather than by deleting them, employing refinement operators. In this paper, we build on previously introduced axiom weakening for \ALC, and show how it can be extended to deal with \SROIQ, the expressive and decidable description logic underlying OWL 2 DL.
We here focus on describing a prototype implementation computing axiom weakening for \SROIQ and discuss a number of performance and evaluation aspects.
%the definitions of the refinement operators to deal with \SROIQ constructs, in particular with %such as reflexive and irreflexive roles, disjoint roles, 
%role hierarchies,  cardinality constraints and nominals, and illustrate its application. Finally, we discuss the problem of termination of an iterated weakening procedure.

% describe the ALC syntax and semantics
Formally, an ontology is a set of statements expressed in a suitable logical language and with the purpose of describing a specific domain of interest.

\section{Extending Weakening to \SROIQ}

% describe the SROIQ syntax
% describe roles and concepts
We now give a brief description of the DL \SROIQ; for full details see \cite{baader_horrocks_lutz_sattler_2017,HorrocksKutzSattlerKR2006}. The syntax of \SROIQ is based on a vocabulary of three disjoint sets $N_I$, $N_R$, $N_C$ of \emph{individual names}, \emph{role names}, and \emph{concept names}. The set of \SROIQ \emph{concepts} and \emph{roles} is generated by the following grammar.

\begin{eqnarray*}
  R, S & ::= & U \mid E \mid r \mid r^{-} \enspace,\\
  C & ::= & \bot \mid \top \mid A \mid \neg C \mid C \sqcap C \mid C \sqcup C \mid \forall R.C \mid \exists R.C \mid \\ 
  & & \more n S.C \mid \less n S.C \mid \exists S.\self \mid \nominal i \enspace,
\end{eqnarray*}

where $r \in N_R$ is a role name, $A \in N_C$ is a concept name, $i \in N_i$ is an individual name and $n \in \mathbb{N}_0$ is a non-negative integer. $U$ and $E$ are respectively the universal role and empty role. $S$ is a \emph{simple role} (see below) in the RBox $\Rmc$.

% describe the TBox, ABox and RBox statements
A \emph{TBox} $\Tmc$ is a finite set of concept inclusions (GCIs) of the form $C \sqsubseteq D$ where $C$ and $D$ are concepts. The TBox is used to stores terminological knowledge concerning the relationship between concepts. A \emph{ABox} $\Amc$ is a finite set of statements of the form $R(a)$, $\lnot R (a)$, $a = b$, and $a \not= b$ where $R$ is a role and $a$ and $b$ are individual names. The ABox expresses knowledge regarding individuals in the domain. A \emph{RBox} $\Rmc$ is a finite set of role inclusions (RIAs) of the form $R_1 \circ \cdots \circ R_n \sqsubseteq R$, and disjoint role axioms $\disjoint(S_1, S_2)$ where $R$, $R_1$, $\dots$, $R_n$, $S_1$, and $S_2$ are roles. $S_1$ and $S_2$ are simple (see next) in the RBox $\Rmc$. The special case of $n = 1$ is a simple role inclusion, while we call the cases where $n > 1$ complex role inclusions. The RBox represents knowledge about the relationship between roles.

% describe simple and complex roles since it is relevant
The set of \emph{non-simple} roles in $\Rmc$ is the smallest set such that: $U$ and $E$ are non-simple; any role $R$ that appears on the right-hand side of a complex role inclusion $R_1 \circ \cdots \circ R_n \sqsubseteq R$ where $n > 1$ is non-simple; any role $R$ that appears on the right-hand side of a simple role inclusion $S \sqsubseteq R$ where $S$ is non-simple, is also non-simple; and a role $r$ is non-simple if and only if $r^-$ is non-simple.
All other roles are \emph{simple}.

% describe regularity since it is relevant
For convenience, let us define the function $\inv(R)$ such that $\inv(r) = r^-$ and $\inv(r^-) = r$ for all role names $r \in N_R$. A RBox $\Rmc$ is \emph{regular} if there exists a pre-order $\preceq$, i.e., a transitive and reflexive relation, over the set of roles such that $R \preceq S \iff \inv(R) \preceq \inv(S)$, $R \preceq S \iff \inv(R) \preceq S$, and all RIAs in $\Rmc$ are of the forms:
$\inv(R) \sqsubseteq R$,
$R \circ R \sqsubseteq R$,
$S \sqsubseteq R$, $R \circ S_1 \circ \cdots \circ S_n \sqsubseteq R$,
$S_1 \circ \cdots \circ S_n \circ R \sqsubseteq R$, or
$S_1 \circ \cdots \circ S_n \sqsubseteq R$
where $r \in N_R$ is a role name and $R$, $S$, $S_1, \cdots, S_n$ are roles such that $S \preceq R$, $S_i \preceq R$, and $R \not\preceq S_i$ for $i = 1, \dots, n$.

A \SROIQ ontology $\Omc = \Tmc \cup \Amc \cup \Rmc$ consists of a TBox $\Tmc$, an ABox $\Amc$, and a RBox $\Rmc$, where $\Rmc$ is regular.

% describe the semantics
% whats a interpretation, when is it a model
The semantics of \SROIQ are defined using \emph{interpretations} $I = \langle \Delta^I, \cdot^I \rangle$ where $\Delta^I$ is a non-empty \emph{domain} and $\cdot^I$ is a function associating to each individual name $a$ an element of the domain $a^I \in \Delta^I$, to each concept $C$ a subset of the domain $C^I \subseteq \Delta^I$, and to each role $R$ a binary relation on the domain $R^I \subseteq \Delta^I \bigtimes \Delta^I$; see \cite{baader_horrocks_lutz_sattler_2017,HorrocksKutzSattlerKR2006} for further details. An interpretation $I$ is a \emph{model} for $\Omc$ if it satisfies all the axioms in $\Omc$.

% describe subsumptions of concepts and roles
Given two concepts $C$ and $D$ we say that $C$ is \emph{subsumed} by $D$ (or $D$ \emph{subsumes} $C$) with respect to the ontology $\Omc$, written $C \sqsubseteq_\Omc D$, if $C^I \subseteq D^I$ in every model $I$ of $\Omc$. Further $C$ is \emph{strictly subsumed by} $D$, written $C \sqsubset_\Omc D$, if $C \sqsubseteq_\Omc D$ but not $D \sqsubseteq_\Omc C$. Analogously, given two roles $R$ and $S$, $R$ is subsumed by $S$ with respect to $\Omc$ ($R \sqsubseteq_\Omc S$) if $R^I \sqsubseteq S^I$ in all models $I$ of $\Omc$. Again, $R \sqsubset_\Omc S$ holds if $R \sqsubseteq_\Omc S$ but not $D \sqsubseteq_\Omc C$
