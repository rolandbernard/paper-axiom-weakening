%% The abstract is a short summary of the work to be presented in the
%% article.
\begin{abstract}
Axiom weakening is a technique that allows for a fine-grained repair of inconsistent ontologies. Its main advantage is that it repairs ontologies by making axioms
less restrictive rather than by deleting them, employing refinement operators. In this paper, we build on previously introduced axiom weakening for \ALC, and show how it can be extended to deal with \SROIQ, the expressive and decidable description logic underlying OWL 2 DL.
We here focus on describing a prototype implementation computing axiom weakening for \SROIQ and discuss a number of performance and evaluation aspects.
%the definitions of the refinement operators to deal with \SROIQ constructs, in particular with %such as reflexive and irreflexive roles, disjoint roles, 
%role hierarchies,  cardinality constraints and nominals, and illustrate its application. Finally, we discuss the problem of termination of an iterated weakening procedure.

\section{Introduction: Weakening for debugging}

% motivate repair using axiom weakening
% give an example ontology where classical repairs are insufficient
% give an example where it is advantageous to weaken the role hierarchy

    Some examples for some \SROIQ features.
\end{example}

% lay out the constraints that we want to maintain
% explain how each of them can be ensured

% proof that the constrains are retained

\section{Implementing Axiom Weakening for \SROIQ}

% explain how the weakening is used for repair

\section{Weakening makes you strong: evaluation aspects}

% explain how different repairs are compared
